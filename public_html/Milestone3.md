<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 2: </em> Handling Data Changes</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>The API would be involved because it is clicking on the recipe the<br>user liked and once the user likes the recipe, it will show the<br>user what he has liked through a series of queries. The logic that<br>i had was to make this as very user friendly.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>

And it made it alot of fun.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I feel like i did pretty decent with the project. I felt like<br>not understanding what it was originally about, made me feel like I just<br>chose the api in order to satisfy the requirements. I def would have<br>picked something that has inspired me rather than just picking an item that<br>was from the top.&nbsp; &nbsp;Am i honestly happy with the results that i<br>got, I honestly feel like i can do a whole lot better if<br>given another chance since i now understand what this project was about.&nbsp; Overall,<br>it was actually alot of fun to do this project.&nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 4: </em> Summarize your experience per the checklist items</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>I honestly had 0 experience with web development.&nbsp; To me, everything that the<br>professor talked in the beginning was a whole new language for me.&nbsp; I<br>am super happy i took this class with professor Togel because he really<br>helped me alot with learning the course.&nbsp; I honestly feel a whole lot<br>better becasue i actually understand what is currently happening.&nbsp; If i would do<br>something different, i would completely do a different api because of how it<br>has issues for the user.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p><br></td></tr>
